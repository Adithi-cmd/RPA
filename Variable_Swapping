3.1.3Step by Step Process

Step 1:	Open UiPath Studio.
Step 2:	Create a process and name it as “Variable Swapping”
Step 3:	Drag a Sequence activity from the Activities panel and drop in the Designer panel.

Step 4:	Name the Sequence activity as “Sequence – ‘This code is for swapping two numbers using a third variable’”
Step 5:	Insert a Comment activity from the Activities panel within the Sequence activity.
Step 6:	Add comment “Taking input of two numbers from the user and swap them by using a third variable.”
Step 7:	Drag another Sequence activity from the Activities panel and insert it below the Comment activity.
Step 8:	Name the Sequence activity as “Sequence – ‘For prompting the user to give the input'”.
Step 9:	Right-click on the Sequence activity container and select Annotations from the context menu.
Step 10:	Enter an annotation “This code is for swapping two numbers by using a third variable.”
Step 11:	Insert an Input Dialog activity within the second Sequence activity and name it as “Input Dialog – ‘First Variable by User’”.
Step 12:	Right-click on the Input Dialog activity container and select Annotations from the context menu. Add an annotation : “Taking User input and storing the value in "First_Input"”.
Step 13:	In the Input Dialog activity, enter values as shown below:


Title	Label
“First Value”	“Please enter the first numeric value: ”

Step 14:	In the Variables panel, create a variable for the above Input Dialog activity as shown below:

Name	Variable type	Scope	Default
First_Input_Value	Double	Sequence – ‘This code is for swapping two numbers by using a
third variable’	

Step 15:	Go to the Properties panel of the Input Dialog activity and insert
First_Input_Value in its Output property.
Step 16:	Insert a second Input Dialog activity below the previous Input Dialog activity, and name it as “Input Dialog – ‘Second variable by User’”.
Step 17:	Right-click on the Input Dialog activity container and select Annotations from the context menu. Add an annotation : “Taking User input and storing the value in "Second_Input_Value”.
Step 18:	In the second Input Dialog activity, enter values as shown below:


Title	Label
“Second Value”	“Please enter the second numeric value: ”

Step 19:	In the Variables panel, create a variable for the second Input Dialog activity as shown below:

Name	Variable type	Scope	Default
Second_Input_Value	Double	Sequence – ‘This code is for swapping two numbers by using a third
variable’	

Step 20:	Go to the Properties panel of the Input Dialog activity and insert the variable
Second_Input_Value in its Output property.
Step 21:	Insert a Write Line activity from the Activities panel after the second Sequence activity, and name it as “Write Line – ‘Value entered before swapping’”.
Step 22: Right-click on the Write Line activity container and select Annotations from the context menu. Add an annotation : “Enter the text to get the result in the Output Panel”.
Step 23:  In the text box of the Write Line activity, enter the expression: “First Value is: ” + First_Input_Value.ToString + Environment.NewLine + “Second Value is: ” + Second_Input_Value.ToString

Step 24:	Insert another Sequence activity from the Activities panel below the Write Line activity, name it as “Sequence – ‘Swapping of numbers’” and annotate it as “This block of code will swap the values of the numbers entered”.
Step 25:	In the Variables panel, create a new variable as shown below:


Name	Variable type	Scope	Default
Swapping_Support_Variable	Double	Sequence – ‘This code is for swapping two numbers by using
a third variable’	

Step 26:	Insert an Assign activity in the third Sequence activity, name it as “Assign – ‘Move the First_Input_Value to Swapping_Support_Variable’” and enter the annotation : “Swap Swapping_Support with First_Input_Value”.
Step 27:	In the Assign activity, enter values as shown below:


To	Value
Swapping_Support_Variable	First_Input_Value

Step 28:	Insert a second Assign activity below the previous Assign activity, name it as “Assign – ‘Move the Second_Input_Value to First_Input_Value’” and Enter the annotation “Swap First_Input_Value with Second_Input_Value”.
Step 29:	In the second Assign activity, enter values as shown below:


To	Value
First_Input_Value	Second_Input_Value

Step 30:	Insert a third Assign activity below the second Assign activity, name it as “Assign – ‘To swap Swapping_Support_Variable with Second_Input_Value’” and enter annotation: “Swap Second_Input_Value with Swapping_Support”.

Step 31:	In the third Assign activity, enter values as shown below:



To	Value
Second_Input_Value	Swapping_Support_Variable

Step 32:	Insert a Write Line activity below the third Sequence activity, name it as “Write Line – ‘Swapped Result’” and enter annotation: “Enter the text to get the result in Output Panel”.
Step 33:	In the text box of the Write Line activity, enter the expression: “First Value after swapping is: “ + First_Input_Value.ToString + Environment.NewLine + “Second Value after swapping is: “ + Second_Input_Value.ToString”
Step 34:	Save and run the workflow.
